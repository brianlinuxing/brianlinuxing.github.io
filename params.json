I have done the lot: managed Mainframes, set-up Datacentres, coded in Assembler (MACRO-10), FORTRAN, COBOL, etc the whole ball of wax!\r\n\r\n### Linux \r\n\r\nI prefer to use and do Linux, whenever I can, having started with Slackware in 1994. I can talk about the topic for hours! I give free classes on Linux in London. \r\n\r\n### Mobile\r\n\r\nI am hoping to release some mobile apps by the beginning of 2016.\r\n\r\n### Ideas and a critical eye\r\n\r\nAfter 30+ years of IT I tend to see the world differently and brim with ideas on how to do things better, smarter and with less hassle. I cover a wide range of technology with a critical eye.\r\n\r\nAs a freelancer, I provide a high degree of objectivity on modern problems and issues. I am always open to sensible offers. Or just ask me a question! \r\n\r\nMy ever on-going [Wiki](https://github.com/brianlinuxing/brianlinuxing.github.io/wiki) has some quick solutions to tricky technological [gotchas.](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gotcha)","google":"UA-68182525-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
