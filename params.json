I have done the lot: managed Mainframes, set-up Datacentres, coded in Assembler (MACRO-10), FORTRAN, COBOL, etc the whole ball of wax!\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nI prefer to use and do Linux, whenever I can, having started with Slackware in 1994.\r\n\r\n### Ideas and a critical eye\r\n\r\nAfter 30+ years of IT I see the world differently and brim with ideas on how to do to things better, smarter and with less hassle. I provide a high degree of objectivity on modern problems and issues. Ask me a question!","google":"UA-68182525-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
